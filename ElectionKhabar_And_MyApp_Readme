Explanation of two apps:

ELECTIONSKHABAR:

This is the one I am currently working on.

It aims at easing the information access by the people, through various options.The app gathers all the relevant news at a single place and presents to the user through various options and filters.
Here are some salient features of the app:
-lists all news of the country at a single place
-provides various useful filters that enable user to quickly access information a particular party or candidate.
-user can custom build his own newspaper that displays information relevant only to the user, so that they remain updated about their favourite topics.
-a discussion forum for users, where user are provided with an option to comment on the news articles and discuss with other peers.
-users have a choice to read news from any of their favourite newspaper/combining more than one newspaper, thus providing them with a rich source of news all at a place.

Right now, the "hot discussions" and the "top news" part is left.

2.ChangeWallpaper: Take a pic and set it as the wallpaper
3.Email: User can send an email to anyone in their contact list, just entering their name and message.
4.Push notifications: NOtification whenever the wallpaper is changed through that app
