Aim : To Send a Custom Data Type from a Remote Service to our Activity

Functionalities covered:
1.Communicating with a Remote Service (using Messenger)
2.Sending Custom Data Type from Service to Activity using Parcelable class

Workflow :

Components : 

A custom data class - GadgetData, that extends Parcelable class and contains some Specifications - Size, Android OS Version, Connectivity, 
Processor, Camera Specifications, SD Card storage etc, for some android models.

A Remote service  - AndroidGadgetDataService, that populates the array of the data class and sends one of the items to the activity using the messenger.

A ListActivity - AndroidGadgetSpecActivity, that contains a listview of all the model names.
The user taps on a particular model and its index is sent to the service and the service returns all its specs.

An activity - DetailedView, that displays all the specs returned by the service.


Communication between the service and listactivity takes place through the messengers of both.
First, we bind the activity to the service and store the messenger of the service's handler in the activity.
Similarly, we store the messenger of the activty's handler in the service.

Then, communication takes place between the two through their messengers.

How To Use : 

Tap on any model name and you will get all its specs.

ToDo's:

->Dynamically add a new model with all its specs.

Feel free to use the app and report if you find any bug.

Cheers !
