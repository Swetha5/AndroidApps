Workflow :

A remote service, that crawls the web page using the jsoup library and sends back the results to the activity.
All the crawling work is done on a separate thread, not the main thread.

Communication between service and activity takes place through the messengers of both.
First, we bind the activity to the service and store the messenger of the service's handler in the activity.
Similarly, we store the messenger of the activty's handler in the service.

Then, communication takes place between the two through their messengers.
